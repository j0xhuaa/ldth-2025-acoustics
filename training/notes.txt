CHECKPOINT: Trained the model on log mel spectrograms and saved to disk, as a basic starting point.
(Also created a mini streamlit dashboard for viewing the spectrograms, mostly to assist with conceptualising audio data.)

NEXT: Evaluate the model against the test data, and determine performance on unseen samples.
(Train a model on 1D waveform array and compare performance)
(Depending on performance, trial an ensemble model, trained on both, or a third feature)
(Add a creative streamlit component that visually classifies the audio on a dashboard for an operator potentially vibe code that in flask)
